# Git Privacy Setup

If you want to use Git under a secret identity, you will find this tool useful.

## What it does?

* Setup author name and email for commits.
* Setup GPG signing key for signing your commits.
* Setup SSH private key to be used for Git over SSH authentication.
* Setup SOCKS5 proxy for all standard Git protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.
* Convert timezone to UTC for your commits, and remove hours, minutes, and seconds details.

## Installation

You have to install this tool under a path with no spaces. Suppose you want to
install it under `/var/git-privacy-setup` (Unix) or `C:\git-privacy-setup`
(Windows), then do the following:

Please change the SOCKS5 proxy setting in the following command:

```
# For Unix
cd /var/git-privacy-setup

# For Windows
cd C:\git-privacy-setup

# Clone the project through a SOCKS5 proxy
git init
git config http.proxy "socks5h://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080"
git remote add origin "https://github.com/cramershoup/git-privacy-setup.git"
git pull origin master
```

Add `/var/git-privacy-setup/bin` (Unix) or `C:\git-privacy-setup\bin` (Windows)
to your `PATH` environment variable. Please don't use symbolic link to install.

## Usage

Inside any Git repository root directory, run:

```bash
git privacy-setup [profile]
```

Follow the instructions to setup your Git repository. These settings are only
valid for the current repository, you need to setup each individual repository.

You can use or edit a common profile by specifying the `profile` parameter.
